# Experiment 2 — Linux Basics & Commands

## 1. Experiment 2
Introduction to Linux basics, filesystem, commands, permissions, user management, and practice tasks.

## 2. Theory: Understanding Linux File Systems
- Linux follows a hierarchical directory structure.
- Root directory `/` is the starting point of all paths.
- Common directories:
  - `/home` – user directories
  - `/etc` – configuration files
  - `/bin`, `/usr/bin` – executable programs
  - `/var` – logs and variable data

## 3. File Permissions and Ownership
- File permissions determine read (r), write (w), execute (x).
- Ownership includes user, group, and others.
- Commands:
  - `ls -l` — view permissions  
  - `chmod` — change permissions  
  - `chown` — change owner

## 4. Basic Navigation Commands
- `pwd` — print working directory
- `ls` — list files
- `cd` — change directory
- `tree` — directory tree view (if installed)

## 5. File Operations
- `touch file.txt`
- `cp source dest`
- `mv old new`
- `rm file.txt`
- `mkdir newfolder`
- `rmdir emptyfolder`

## 6. File Viewing and Editing
- `cat file`
- `more file`
- `less file`
- `head -n 10 file`
- `tail -n 10 file`

## 7. Text Editors: nano and vim
- `nano file.txt` — beginner-friendly
- `vim file.txt` — advanced editor

## 8. User Management
- `whoami`
- `id`
- `sudo adduser username`
- `sudo passwd username`

## 9. System Information
- `uname -a`
- `df -h`
- `free -m`
- `top`
- `htop` (if installed)

## 10. Practice Exercises
Hands‑on lab tasks for mastery.

## 11. Question Bank / Lab Exam
Practice questions related to Linux basics.

## 12. Task 1: Directory Navigation
Create directories and navigate using `cd`, `ls`, etc.

## 13. Task 2: File Creation and Content
Use `touch`, `echo`, and redirection (`>`, `>>`).

## 14. Task 3: File Operations
Copying, moving, renaming, deleting files.

## 15. Task 4: File Permissions
Use `chmod`, `chown`, and verify using `ls -l`.

## 16. Task 5: File Viewing
Use `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`.

## 17. Task 6: Text Editing
Use nano/vim to edit text files.

## 18. Task 7: System Information
Check CPU, memory, disk, and kernel info.

## 19. Task 8: File Organization
Create structured directories and categorize files.

## 20. Task 9: Process and History
- `ps`
- `history`
- `kill PID`

## 21. Task 10: Comprehensive Cleanup
Delete unnecessary files, reorganize folders.

## 22. Summary
- Linux commands are powerful.
- Understanding file structure is essential.
- Practice improves command‑line confidence.
